			<greetings>
				<message>A bunch of bones suddenly decided to rebuild into walking skeleton. This is going to get nasty.</message>
				<message>Skeletons suck. Sadly, the one you've met on your way plans to change your point of view.</message>
				<message>One of the adventurers that tried to raid this dungeon and failed decided to beat the crap out of you, because reasons.</message>
        			<message>Skeletons are spooky. Skeletons that are planning to kill you are even worse - you are going to learn that hard way.</message>
        			<message>Wow. A skeleton. This is surely going to be most unique encounter in your life.</message>
        			<message>The worst nightmare of an elementary school student that just visited biology class is going to happen right here, right now.</message>
			</greetings>
			<hit>
				<message>The skeleton cuts you with his rusty sword for %D% damage!</message>
				<message>What a cruel hit from the skeleton! He just sust slammed his skull into you and did %D% damage!</message>
				<message>Guess what the skeleton can do? Bite you. Yeah. By the way, this did %D% damage. Ouch!</message>
				<message>Legends say that skeletons and other undead guys are capable of regenerating. You seem to be unable to do so: otherwise, why would your enemy hit you for %D% damage?</message>
				<message>Despite consisting of bones, this guy managed to hit you rather hard, leaving you without %D% HP</message>
        			<message>Apparently, being dead for a long time is not something that can hurt your swordsmanship skills. That %D% damage hit from the skeleton was totally unexpected!</message>
			</hit>
			<death>
				<message>The skeleton went back to his usual state: lying around without any purpose after taking %D% damage from you.</message>
				<message>The skeleton is dead now. Twice. All thanks to your hit - you just beat %D% hitpoints out of him!</message>
        			<message>Dying twice in a row sucks, probably. The skeleton wont confirm that for you; he's dead, you know, hitting him for %D% damage didn't suddenly resurrect him.</message>
        			<message>Well, he's dead. Not to say he wasn't before, but smashing his skull and dealing %D% damage was a good way to ensure his demise.</message>
			</death>
			<loot>
				<message>Amongst the bones there is %GLD% gold. And guess what? You've learned something new today. Something worth %EXP% experience.</message>
				<message>Since this guy did not manage to survive in this dungeon, you decided that his %GLD% coins won't help him anymore. Lesson learned, surviving here is hard. Thats why you got %EXP% experience from this fight.</message>
        			<message>Robbing someone is not something you should do. While getting %GLD% gold is nice and all, killing a dude for the second time in his life and getting his loot is not something that the Dungeon Court will approve, if it even exists. Better get those %EXP% experience points to use if you're ever gonna meet them.</message>
				<message>Whoever overlooked the wealth of this guy after killing him missed a bunch of goodies. %GLD% spare gold is something that's nice to have. You've remembered that well, gaining %EXP% experience.</message>
        			<message>"Day one of my adventures: I think I'll go deeper for now. Saw some skeletons out there, should take care of that. I hope %GLD% gold is not going to be worthless in here". Yeah, sure, writing a diary is a good idea for hobby in a dungeon full of monsters. At least his gold will serve you well from now on, along with %EXP% hard earned experience points recieved from killing him.</message>
